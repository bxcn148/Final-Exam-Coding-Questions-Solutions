Write an LC3 assembly program that will read a single lowercase character input from the keyboard (a – z) and print it to the display, looping until the user hits the “Enter” key.

After the user hits the “Enter” key, the program should then display a message saying “You entered: “, as well as ALL of the characters entered converted to UPPERCASE. For example, if the user hit the enter key after typing in “atqm” the program should show:

“`

atqm

You entered: ATQM

“`

Lastly, the program should loop indefinitely, so the user can enter in multiple combinations of characters. Here is an example output:

“`

atqm

You entered: ATQM

abcdefg

You entered: ABCDEFG

zzzzzz

You entered: ZZZZZZ

“`

Write an LC3 assembly program that will prompt the user to enter a single digit number 0 to 9 (inclusive). You can expect the user will always enter a single digit number that is between 0 and 9.

Next, based on the user input print the following to the display:

1. If user’s input was less than 5 print:

The number you entered was less than 5!

2. If user’s input was equal to 5 print:

The number you entered was equal to 5!

3. If user’s input was greater than 5 print:

The number you entered was greater than 5!

Lastly, the program should loop indefinitely allowing the user to type in a single digit number as many times as they want.

Here is an example of the program running using all acceptable inputs:

“`

Please enter a number: 0

The number you entered was less than 5!

Please enter a number: 1

The number you entered was less than 5!

Please enter a number: 2

The number you entered was less than 5!

Please enter a number: 3

The number you entered was less than 5!

Please enter a number: 4

The number you entered was less than 5!

Please enter a number: 5

The number you entered was equal to 5!

Please enter a number: 6

The number you entered was greater than 5!

Please enter a number: 7

The number you entered was greater than 5!

Please enter a number: 8

The number you entered was greater than 5!

Please enter a number: 9

The number you entered was greater than 5!
